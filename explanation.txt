Explanation:

This code is so much shorter than the original code. It generates a deterministic partition key absed on the input event, and it  handles
various scenarious such as when the even tdoes not have a partition key or when the partition key is not a string.
It uses better variable names, uses a different way to determine whether candidate will be stringified or not according to its type.
It eliminates the unnecessary code for returning the trivial partition key by defining the cadidate as the default in the beginning.
It also writes the creating hash part in different lines to make it more readable. Furthermore, it eliminates all the else clauses in the code.
